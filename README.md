Two-Point Pade Approximation
The two-point pade approximation method is based on the paper "Applications of Padé Approximations in Signal Analysis" by Amindavar. This method approximates the probability density function (PDF) of a function by considering its behavior near two key points: zero and infinity.

The approach primarily relies on moments and Padé approximation techniques.
